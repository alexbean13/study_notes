\subsection{Fix the Personal Access Token}
From August 13, 2021, GitHub is no longer accepting account passwords 
when authenticating Git operations. 
You need to add a PAT (Personal Access Token) instead, 
and you can follow the below method to add a PAT on your system.\\

Ref:\\
\url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68775869/support-for-password-authentication-was-removed-please-use-a-personal-access-to}\\
    
Create Personal Access Token on GitHub:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item From your GitHub account, go to Settings.
        \item Developer Settings 
        \item Personal Access Token
        \item Generate New Token (Give your password)
        \item Fillup the form => click Generate token
        \item Copy the generated Token, it will be something like $ghp_sFhFsSHhTzMDreGRLjmks4Tzuzgthdvfsrta$
    \end{itemize}
    Now follow below method based on your machine:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For Windows OS:\\
                Go to Credential Manager from Control Panel => 
                Windows Credentials => 
                find git:https://github.com => 
                Edit => 
                On Password replace with with your GitHub Personal Access Token => You are Done
                If you dont find git:https://github.com => Click on Add a generic credential => Internet address will be git:https://github.com and you need to type in your username and password will be your GitHub Personal Access Token => Click Ok and you are done
    \end{itemize}
