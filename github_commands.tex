Ref:\\
\url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68775869/support-for-password-authentication-was-removed-please-use-a-personal-access-to}\\

From August 13, 2021, GitHub is no longer accepting account passwords 
when authenticating Git operations. 
You need to add a PAT (Personal Access Token) instead, 
and you can follow the below method to add a PAT on your system.\\
    Create Personal Access Token on GitHub:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item From your GitHub account, go to Settings.
        \item Developer Settings 
        \item Personal Access Token
        \item Generate New Token (Give your password)
        \item Fillup the form => click Generate token
        \item Copy the generated Token, it will be something like $ghp\_sFhFsSHhTzMDreGRLjmks4Tzuzgthdvfsrta$
    \end{itemize}
    Now follow below method based on your machine:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For Windows OS:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Go to Credential Manager from Control Panel
            \item Windows Credentials
            \item find git:https://github.com
            \item Edit, on Password replace with with your GitHub Personal Access Token
            \item You are Done
            \item If you dont find \url{git:https://github.com} 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Click on Add a generic credential
                \item Internet address will be \url{git:https://github.com}
                \item Fill username, password is your GitHub Personal Access Token 
                \item Click Ok and you are done.
            \end{itemize} 
        \end{itemize}    
    \end{itemize}
